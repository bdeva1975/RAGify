# RAGify

## Overview

RAGify is a powerful framework for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using OpenAI's models and ChromaDB for embedding storage and retrieval. This approach combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with a retrieval system, allowing the model to generate informed responses based on specific data or knowledge bases.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a method that enhances the capabilities of generative models by integrating an external knowledge retrieval mechanism. This allows the model to access up-to-date and relevant information during the response generation process, significantly improving the quality and accuracy of the outputs.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval:** Access and utilize specific datasets or documents to inform responses.
- **Seamless Integration:** Built-in support for OpenAI's language models and embedding functions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive Streamlit application for easy interaction.

## Use Cases

RAG is particularly useful for various applications, including:

- **Question & Answer Systems:** Answer user queries with specific, domain-related information. This is ideal for knowledge bases, customer support systems, and educational platforms.
  
- **Intelligent Search:** Provide users with enhanced search capabilities that return contextually relevant answers rather than just document links.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to OpenAI API (an API key)
- ChromaDB for embedding storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bdeva1975/RAGify.git
   cd RAGify
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Launch the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run rag_app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the RAGify application.

### Code Structure

- `rag_lib.py`: This module contains the core logic for RAG, including functions for managing collections, querying embeddings, and generating responses using OpenAI.
  
- `rag_app.py`: The Streamlit application that serves as the user interface for interacting with the RAG system.

## Usage

1. **Input Your Query:** Type a question in the provided text area.
  
2. **Generate Response:** Click the "Go" button to retrieve an answer. The system will fetch relevant documents and provide an answer based on the retrieved information.
  
3. **View Search Results:** Expand the section to see the documents used to generate the answer.
